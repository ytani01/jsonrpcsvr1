# Code Style and Conventions

The project adheres to standard Python code style and conventions, enforced by the following tools:

- **flake8**: For general code style and linting.
- **isort**: For consistent import sorting.
- **mypy** and **pyright**: For static type checking, ensuring type consistency and catching potential errors early.
- **ruff**: For fast linting and formatting, ensuring code quality and consistency.

Specific naming conventions, docstring styles, or other detailed guidelines are not explicitly documented, but it's expected to follow common Python practices (e.g., PEP 8 for naming).
