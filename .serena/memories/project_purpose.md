# Project Purpose

This project, `jsonrpcsvr1`, is a Work in Progress (WIP) sample JSON-RPC server.
It aims to provide a simple, extensible, and high-performance JSON-RPC API.
It leverages `fastapi-jsonrpc`, `FastAPI`, and `Uvicorn` to achieve this.
The server exposes an API that can be interacted with via standard JSON-RPC requests, and it also provides a Swagger UI for API exploration and testing.
